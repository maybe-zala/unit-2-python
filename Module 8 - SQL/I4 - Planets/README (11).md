## Stuck?...Where you can find help 🆘

**You do not need to memorise SQL queries** even the best programmers need to look up commands and the more you use the commands the more familiar they will become.

1. You are going to be editing code, so the starting code will already be completed for you. 
2. You can look at the **CheatSheetSilver.jpg** to help remind you how to use the ORDER BY commands. For queryF and queryG you may need to refer to the **CheatSheetBronze.jpg** to remind yourself how to do the WHERE commands.
3. You can use Google to find the code you need.



#### Good luck! 🍀
