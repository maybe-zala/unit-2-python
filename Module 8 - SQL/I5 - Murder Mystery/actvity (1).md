# Murder Mystery 🚔🚨
## Silver 🥈

### Welcome! 👋 

**To do this activity, you will need to know the following SQL commands; SELECT, FROM/WHERE, AND, OR, ORDER BY**

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## The activity

You have been given the 🚔🚨**police**🚨🚔 database that contains all the information needed to help solve the murder. You can see the what tables and column names there are by clicking on **tablesColumns**.

To get started, look at the **firstClue.jpg**. Here is what we know so far; There was a **murder** on the **15th of January 2018** in **SQL City** 

We have started the first query for you in **main.sql**, that will lead you to your next clue. 

Once you run your queries and have the results from your database:
- Remember to update your **detective notes** and keep a record of the SQL commands you used.
- Once you think you have identified the murderer, type in the following command and insert the name you have found: INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Insert the fullname of the person you found here');
SELECT value FROM solution;

## Stuck?...Where you can find help 🆘

**You do not need to memorise SQL queries**, even the best programmers need to look up commands and the more you use the commands the more familiar they will become.

1. You can look at the **CheatSheetSilver.jpg** to help remind you how to use the ORDER BY commands. You may need to refer to the **CheatSheetBronze.jpg** to remind yourself how to do the WHERE commands.
2. You can use Google to find the code you need.



#### Good luck! 🍀
