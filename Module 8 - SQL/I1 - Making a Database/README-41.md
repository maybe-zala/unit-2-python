## Stuck?...Where you can find help 🆘

**You do not need to memorise SQL queries**, even the best programmers need to look up commands and the more you use the commands the more familiar they will become.

- You can use Google to find the code you need. For example, if you are not sure how to insert data into your database simply Google, "insert data into sql table" to find help.



#### Good luck! 🍀
