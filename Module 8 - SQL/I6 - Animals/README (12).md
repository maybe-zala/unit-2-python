## Stuck?...Where you can find help 🆘

**You do not need to memorise SQL queries** even the best programmers need to look up commands and the more you use the commands the more familiar they will become.

1. You can look at the **CheatSheetGold.jpg** to help remind you how to use the ORDER BY commands. To remind yourself how to do the WHERE commands you can refer to the **CheatSheetBronze.jpg** and for a reminder of the ORDER BY commands there is the **CheatSheetSilver.jpg**
2. You can use Google to find the code you need.



#### Good luck! 🍀
