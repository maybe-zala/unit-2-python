## SQL COMPARISON OPERATORS and AND/NOT commands - Bronzeü•â

### Welcome! üëã 

**To do this activity, you will need to know how to filter a database using the COMPARISON OPERATORS; !=, >, <, <=, >= as well as the AND/OR commands **

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## The activity

You will run **7** queries on the üì∏**instagram**üì∏ database that you have been provided.

Start by completing **queryA.sql**, then move onto **queryB.sql** etc. until you have completed all the queries. Each one gives the task that you need to edit the code for. 

## Resources

- Your main resource for this activity the provided powerpoint.

## Stuck?...Where you can find help üÜò

**You do not need to memorise SQL queries**, even the best programmers need to look up commands and the more you use the commands the more familiar they will become.

1. You are going to be editing code, so the starting code will already be completed for you. 
2. You can look at the **CheatSheet.jpg** to help remind you how to use the COMPARISON OPERATORS and AND/NOT commands.
2. You can use Google to find the code you need.



#### Good luck! üçÄ
