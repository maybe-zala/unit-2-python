# I2 - Attributes

You can use attribute references to access variables inside an object. Attribute references use the standard syntax for all attribute references in Python: obj.name. Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the classâ€™s namespace when the class object was created. So, if the class definition looked like this:
```
class MyClass:
    year = 2021

    def say_hello(self):
        return 'hello world'
```
then MyClass.year and MyClass.say_hello are valid attribute references returning an integer and a function object, respectively. Class attributes can be assigned to, so you can change the value of MyClass.year by assignment.
